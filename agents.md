# IMAX Near Me

Interactive map of IMAX theatres worldwide. Filter by projector type — 15/70mm film, GT Laser, single laser, and dome — to find the best IMAX experience near you.

## Architecture

React SPA deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Venue data is fetched at runtime from Cloudflare R2 (`data.imaxnearme.com/imax-venues.json`). No server-side rendering or backend API — the worker serves static assets only.

## Data Pipeline

Venue data is sourced from the [IMAX Fandom Wiki](https://imax.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_IMAX_venues), enriched with Google Places API details (coordinates, address, phone, website), and matched to imax.com theatre pages for showtimes links. Results are cached in `theatre-details.json` and `imax-urls.json` to avoid redundant API calls. The pipeline runs via `npm run fetch-venues` and outputs `imax-venues.json`.

Only premium IMAX projectors are included: 15/70mm film, GT Laser, Laser XT/CoLa, and dome venues. Base-level single 2K xenon/laser screens are filtered out.

## Key Conventions

- **Projector categories**: GT Laser, Laser (XT/CoLa), 15/70mm Film, Dome — each has a distinct marker color (orange, blue, red, purple)
- **Filtering**: Venues match if they satisfy ANY active filter (OR logic). No active filters = nothing shown.
- **Overlapping venues**: Pins at the same coordinates are offset in a circle pattern to remain selectable
- **Geolocation**: Defaults to US center (39.8°N, 98.6°W) at zoom 4; zooms to 8 when user location is found
- **Styles**: Dark theme, glassmorphism panels with backdrop blur, Inter font
